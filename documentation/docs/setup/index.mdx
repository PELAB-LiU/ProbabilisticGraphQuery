# Setup

We provide a docker container capable of building and running our measurement campaign.
The container also functions as a Remote Desktop Server (RDP) with preconfigured development envioronments to inspet and edit the source code.

## Install docker
* Install docker engine following the [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
    * Ensure that you can run docker as a non-root user. See [post-installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* Install a Remote Desktop Client
    * Windows: [Microsoft Remote Desktop](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9wzdncrfj3ps)
    * Ubuntu: [Remmina](https://remmina.org/how-to-install-remmina/)

## Build docker image

Change directory to the repository. Expected location is `.../ProbabilisticGraphQuery$`

Build your own docker image with the following command:
```
docker build -t pgq-devenv devenv/dockerfile
```
:::tip[Note]
Downloading eclipse takes a lot of time. Be patient, or download the eclipse instance manually and replace `RUN wget 'https://www.eclipse.org/downloads ...` with `COPY <your file> eclipse.tar.gz`
:::

Alternatively, import the image using the following command:
```
docker image load -i <my image file>
``` 


## Create container

Create container with the following command
```
docker run -d -u root \
  --name=pgq-devenv \
  --security-opt seccomp=unconfined \
  -p 4100:3389 \
  --shm-size="1gb" \
  -v $(pwd):/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery \
  pgq-devenv
```

(Delayed) You can stop the container with:
```
docker container stop pgq-devenv
```
(Delayed) You can restart the container with:
```
docker container start pgq-devenv
```
:::tip[Note]
If you use `docker exec`, don't forget to set the user to `abc`.
```
docker exec -u abc -it -w /config pgq-devenv /bin/bash
```
:::

## Configuring container

* Connect to the running container from an RDP client (address: `localhost:4100`, username: `abc`, password: `abc`)
* Donload jar dependencies.
  * `/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/sources/hu.bme.mit.delta.api/libs/download.sh`
  * `/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/sources/hu.bme.mit.inf.measurement.utilities/libs/download.sh`
* Launch Eclipse from `Applications -> Development -> Modeling 2024-03`
* Pick a workplace. (Any directory works, but we recommend picking `/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/devenv/workplace`)
* Import all projects from  `/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/sources` (`File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Next -> Select root directory -> /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/sources -> Projects -> Select All -> Finish`)
* Change missing API baseline preferences for `org.eclipse.viatra.query.runtime.rete` to `Warning` or `Ignore`. (`Window -> Preferences -> Plug-in Development -> API Baselines -> Missing API baseline -> Ignore`)
* Import launch configurations from `/config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/devenv/launch_configs` (`File -> Import -> Run/Debug -> Launch Configurations -> Next -> From Directory -> /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/devenv/launch_configs -> tick launch_configs -> Finish`)

## Using the container
* Export runnable jar for measurements: `File -> Export -> Java -> Runnable JAR file -> Next -> Launch configuration (select any, e.g., SAT - Scale - hu.bme.mit.inf.measurement) -> Export destination: /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/measurements/pgq.jar -> select Extract required libraries into generated JAR -> Finish -> (Ignore warnings)`
