# Measurement campaign

## Collecting performance data
Connect to a bash shell in the running container.
``` bash
docker exec -u abc -it -w /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/measurements pgq-devenv /bin/bash
```
The following coomand executes the *incremental* measurement campaign.
``` bash
./measure.sh
```
The following coomand executes the measurement campaign for *scaling*.
``` bash
./measure-scale.sh
```
:::tip[Note]
Running the measurements may take days. Ensure that the campagin is not interrupted.

## Processing the data

<Tabs groupId="data" defaultValue="cmd">
    <TabItem value="cmd" label="Terminal">
    Run the following commands to gnereate the diagrams.
     ```bash
    docker exec -u abc -it -w /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/measurements pgq-devenv jupyter execute diagrams-scale.ipynb
    docker exec -u abc -it -w /config/ProbabilisticGraphQuery/measurements pgq-devenv jupyter execute diagrams.ipynb
    ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="gui" label="GUI">
        Connect to the container via RDP as before.
        * Stat a jupyter notebook from `Applications -> Development -> Jupyter Notebook`
        * Open the notebooks from `ProbabilisticGraphQuery -> measurements -> diagrams[-scale].ipynb`
        * Run notebook. `Run -> Run All Cells`
    </TabItem>
